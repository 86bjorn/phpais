PHP AIS Encoder Decoder v2.0b
-----------------------------

This is a working library for both encoding and decoding AIS sentences using PHP. Version 2 is ais.2.php and almost ready.

### ais.2.php (newer version 2)
+ Decoding: call function process_ais_buf(...), pass in an AIS data from a serial or IP source or a test AIS string
+ Encoding: see the example in the file to form an AIS message, uses the function mk_ais(...)

### decode.ais.php & base.ais.php (older version 1)

The files remain here only for reference. It is superceded by Version 2 above which is more maintainable and neat.

To try, just do the following
+ copy all **php** files to webserver
+ call via web-browser and view the result
+ testing code is towards the end

### feedback and fixes

Please feedback any bugs you may find and be patient with updates and fixes, as I don't even have time to launch my own personal website.

Enjoy this PHP people!
