PHP AIS Encoder Decoder v2.0a
-----------------------------

This is a working library for both encoding and decoding AIS sentences using PHP. Version 2 is ais.2.php and almost ready.

### ais.2.php (newer version 2)
+ this file will be renamed soon and will form the new basis
+ will be making changes constantly till stable

### decode.ais.php (older version 1)

To try, just do the following
+ copy all **php** files to webserver
+ call via web-browser and view the result
+ testing code is towards the end

Please be patient with updates and fixes, as I don't even have time to launch my own personal website.


Enjoy this PHP people...
