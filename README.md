PHP AIS Encoder Decoder v1.0
----------------------------

This is a working library for both encoding **(to be uploaded soon)** and decoding **(uploaded)** AIS sentences using PHP.

Please be patient with updates and fixes, as I don't even have time to launch my own personal website.


### decode.ais.php

To try, just do the following
+ copy **decode.ais.php** file to webserver
+ call via web-browser and view the result
+ testing code is towards the end




Enjoy this PHP people...
